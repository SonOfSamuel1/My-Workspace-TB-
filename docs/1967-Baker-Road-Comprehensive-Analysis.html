MARKET CONDITIONS &amp; TRENDS</h2></p><p><h3>Current Market Snapshot (October 2024 - January 2025)</h3></p><p><strong>Redfin Data (October 2024):</strong></p><p>| Metric | Current Value | Year-over-Year Change | Trend |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| <strong>Median Sale Price</strong> | $266,500 | -7.8% | ↓↓ Declining |
| <strong>Price per SF</strong> | $154 | -21.4% | ↓↓ Sharply Declining |
| <strong>Sales Volume</strong> | 19 homes | 0.0% | → Flat |
| <strong>Days on Market</strong> | 84 days | +48 days (+133%) | ↑↑ Significantly Slower |
| <strong>Sale-to-List Ratio</strong> | 95.5% | -1.7 pts | ↓ Weakening |
| <strong>Homes Sold Above List</strong> | 21.1% | -5.3 pts | ↓ Weakening |</p><p><strong>Market Competitiveness:</strong>
- <strong>Redfin Compete Score:</strong> 18/100 ("not very competitive")
- <strong>Market Type:</strong> Buyer-favorable
- <strong>Typical Sale:</strong> ~6% below asking price
- <strong>Pending Time:</strong> ~98 days average
- <strong>Hot Properties:</strong> Can sell in ~58 days near list price
- <strong>Multiple Offers:</strong> Rare</p><p><strong>INTERPRETATION:</strong> Market is cooling significantly. Extended days on market (+133% increase) and declining prices (-7.8%) indicate weak demand relative to supply. This is a <strong>buyer's market</strong> unfavorable for new development.</p><p><h3>Price Range Variance (Data Discrepancies)</h3></p><p>Different sources report conflicting median prices:
- Redfin (Oct 2024): $289,000 median (down 6.8% YoY)
- Alternative: $293,950 median (down 8%)
- December 2024: $359,000 median
- Another source: $214,000 median (down 33.7% YoY)
- NeighborhoodScout: $222,737 typical value</p><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Significant variance suggests:
1. Different time periods measured
2. Different property types included (renovated vs. unrenovated)
3. Small sample sizes creating volatility
4. Rapid market changes
5. Wide price dispersion in neighborhood</p><p><strong>Consensus Operating Range:</strong> $200K-$360K with current downward pressure</p><p><h3>New Construction Competitive Set</h3></p><p><strong>Current New Construction Examples (Grove Park):</strong></p><p><strong>Empire Communities - "Director" Plan</strong>
- Price: $496,692
- Bedrooms/Baths: 3BR/2.5BA
- Square Footage: 1,528 SF
- Price per SF: $325
- Completion: Recent</p><p><strong>Empire Communities - "Entertainer" Plan</strong>
- Price: $529,900
- Bedrooms/Baths: 2BR/2BA
- Square Footage: 1,371 SF
- Price per SF: $386
- Completion: Recent</p><p><strong>Market Ceiling Analysis:</strong>
- <strong>Current new construction maximum:</strong> $530,000
- <strong>Typical renovated homes:</strong> $300K-$500K
- <strong>General new construction range:</strong> $300K-$500K</p><p><strong>CRITICAL FINDING:</strong> No new construction currently selling above $530K in Grove Park.</p><p><strong>Target Range Comparison:</strong>
- Target (Scenario B): $650K-$900K per home
- Current ceiling: $530K
- <strong>Gap: +23% to +70% above proven market</strong></p><p><strong>Interpretation Options:</strong>
1. <strong>Opportunity:</strong> Market for differentiated, higher-end product exists
2. <strong>Ceiling:</strong> Area fundamentally won't support higher prices
3. <strong>Reality Check:</strong> Pricing expectations need adjustment to market reality</p><p><strong>Most Likely:</strong> Option 3 - pricing must align with market reality</p><p><h3>Land Sales &amp; Vacant Lots</h3></p><p><strong>Current Inventory:</strong>
- 26 land homes for sale in Grove Park
- Median listing price: $350K
- Typical lot sizes: 0.30-0.37 acres (13,000-16,000 SF)</p><p><strong>Your Property Comparison:</strong>
- Size: 1.619 acres (70,527 SF)
- Approximately 5x larger than typical lots
- Subdivision potential creates added value</p><p><strong>Price per SF Analysis:</strong>
- Median listing: $350K ÷ ~15,000 SF = $23/SF
- Your property at $250K: $250K ÷ 70,527 SF = $3.54/SF
- <strong>Implies significant value in subdivision potential</strong></p><p>---</p><p><h2>4. ZONING &amp; REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT</h2></p><p><h3>R-4A Single-Family Residential District</h3></p><p><strong>Permitted Principal Uses:</strong>

   - <strong>At $300K land, Scenario B becomes unprofitable</strong></p><p>2. <strong>Sale Price</strong> (±$25K per home impact)
   - Scenario B: Each $25K price reduction = -$75K total profit
   - Scenario C: Each $25K price reduction = -$100K total profit
   - <strong>5% price reduction can eliminate profitability</strong></p><p>3. <strong>Construction Cost</strong> (±$10/SF impact)
   - Scenario B: $10/SF increase = +$66K cost (3 homes × 2,200 SF)
   - Scenario C: $10/SF increase = +$68K cost (4 homes × 1,700 SF)
   - <strong>10% construction cost overrun eliminates profit</strong></p><p>4. <strong>Infrastructure Cost</strong> (±$50K impact)

- Risk: EXTREME
- Probability of Success: 15%</p><p><h3>Strategic Execution Roadmap</h3></p><p><strong>If Pursuing Tier 1 (Wholesale or Hold):</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Weeks 1-4:</strong> Due diligence (Phase I, survey, title, basic zoning check)
2. <strong>Weeks 4-6:</strong> Negotiate land price to $200K-$225K
3. <strong>Weeks 6-8:</strong> Execute purchase contract
4. <strong>WHOLESALE PATH:</strong>
   - Weeks 8-16: Market to builders, assign contract
   - Collect $30K-$60K fee, exit
5. <strong>HOLD PATH:</strong>
   - Close on property
   - Minimal holding costs (~$3,500/year)
   - Monitor market quarterly
   - Exit Year 3-5 when target appreciation reached</p><p><strong>If Considering Tier 2 (Development):</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Weeks 1-8:</strong> Complete full due diligence per checklist above
2. <strong>Week 8:</strong> GO/NO-GO Decision 1
   - If ANY criteria not met → SWITCH TO TIER 1

4. <strong>Week 12:</strong> GO/NO-GO Decision 2
   - If profit margin &lt;8% → SWITCH TO TIER 1
5. <strong>Weeks 12-24:</strong> Design, permitting (if proceeding)
6. <strong>Months 6-36:</strong> Construction and sales</p><p><h3>Critical Success Factors Summary</h3></p><p><strong>For ANY development scenario to succeed:</strong></p><p>| Factor | Requirement | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| <strong>Land Cost</strong> | ≤$200,000 | MUST ACHIEVE |
| <strong>Market Pricing</strong> | Verified comps at target | MUST VERIFY |
| <strong>Zoning</strong> | Permits desired lots | MUST VERIFY |
| <strong>Infrastructure</strong> | ≤$250,000 costs | MUST VERIFY |
| <strong>Construction</strong> | Locked costs ≤$180/SF | MUST ACHIEVE |
| <strong>Financing</strong> | Available ≤10% rate | MUST SECURE |
| <strong>Risk Tolerance</strong> | Accept potential loss | MUST HAVE |</p><p><strong>If ANY factor cannot be achieved → Default to Tier 1 strategies</strong></p><p><h3>My Final Recommendation</h3></p><p>Based on comprehensive analysis of market conditions, financial modeling, and risk assessment:</p><p><strong>PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION:</strong>
<strong>Pursue Scenario E (Wholesale) as first option, with Scenario D (Hold) as backup if assignment not achieved within 90 days.</strong></p><p><strong>RATIONALE:</strong>
1. <strong>Risk-Reward Profile:</strong> Scenario E offers 200-500% ROI with minimal capital ($5K-$15K) and quick timeline (60-120 days)
2. <strong>Market Alignment:</strong> Current softening market favors wholesale over development
3. <strong>Exit Optionality:</strong> Multiple exit paths (assign, hold, develop later)
4. <strong>Capital Preservation:</strong> Avoids tying up $2M+ in uncertain development
5. <strong>Timing Flexibility:</strong> Can reassess development in 1-2 years when market may support pricing</p><p><strong>SECONDARY CONSIDERATION:</strong>
<strong>Only consider Scenario C (Four Homes) if investor profile matches (experienced developer, high risk tolerance, $2.5M capital) AND all 10 critical success criteria verified in writing.</strong></p><p><strong>DO NOT PURSUE:</strong>
<strong>Scenarios A or B - unacceptable risk-reward profiles given current market conditions.</strong></p><p><h3>Next Step</h3></p><p><strong>Your immediate decision:</strong></p><p>Which investor profile describes you?</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Seeking quick returns, minimal capital at risk → <strong>Scenario E (Wholesale)</strong>
<strong>B.</strong> Patient investor, believe in long-term Grove Park → <strong>Scenario D (Hold)</strong>
<strong>C.</strong> Experienced developer, high risk tolerance, $2.5M available → <strong>Consider Scenario C</strong> (verify ALL criteria first)
<strong>D.</strong> None of the above → <strong>Pass on this opportunity</strong></p><p>Based on your answer, proceed with the appropriate Week 1-4 action plan outlined in Section 16.</p><p>---</p><p><strong>Report Prepared:</strong> January 17, 2025

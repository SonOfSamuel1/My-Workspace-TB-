- Sales Volume: 19 homes sold (0.0% change YoY)
- Days on Market: 84 days (up 48 days YoY - significantly slower)

**Market Competitiveness:**
- Redfin Compete Score: 18/100 ("not very competitive")
- Multiple offers: Rare
- Sale-to-List Ratio: 95.5% (down 1.7 percentage points YoY)
- Typical sale: ~6% below asking price

- Hot properties: Can sell near list in ~58 days
- Homes Sold Above List: 21.1% (down 5.3 percentage points YoY)

**Market Characterization:** Buyer-favorable market with weakening conditions, declining prices, extended listing times, and reduced competition.

### Competing Price Points (Conflicting Data)

**Various sources report different median prices:**
- Redfin (Oct 2024): $289,000 median (down 6.8% YoY)
- Alternative report: $293,950 median (down 8% from previous 12 months)
- December 2024: $359,000 median / $348,850 average
- Another source: $214K median (down 33.7% YoY)
- NeighborhoodScout: Typical home value ~$222,737

**Analysis:** Significant data variance suggests:
1. Different time periods measured
2. Different property types included
3. Small sample sizes creating volatility
4. Rapid market changes
5. Mix of renovated vs. unrenovated properties

**Consensus:** Market operating in $200K-$360K range with downward pressure.

### New Construction Pricing

**Current New Construction Examples (Grove Park):**

**Empire Communities - "Director" Plan:**
- Price: $496,692
- Bedrooms: 3
- Bathrooms: 2.5
- Square Footage: 1,528 sq ft
- Price per sq ft: $325

**Empire Communities - "Entertainer" Plan:**
- Price: $529,900
- Bedrooms: 2
- Bathrooms: 2
- Square Footage: 1,371 sq ft
- Price per sq ft: $386

**General New Construction Range:**
- Typical new construction: $300K-$500K
- Premium new construction closer to Beltline/Proctor Creek Greenway: Higher end of range
- Renovated homes: $300K-$500K typical

**Critical Finding:** Current new construction in Grove Park tops out around $530K, significantly below the $650K-$900K target range. This price point gap represents either:
1. Market opportunity for higher-end product
2. Market ceiling indicating area won't support higher prices
3. Need to reassess target pricing expectations

### Land Sales & Vacant Lots

**Current Land Inventory:**
- 26 land homes for sale in Grove Park
- Median listing price: $350K

**Lot Sizes Mentioned:**
- 70' x 190' lots (approximately 0.30 acres)
- 0.37-acre flat lots

**Price per Square Foot Data:**
- Limited specific data for vacant land transactions
- $63/sq ft reported for residential properties (not vacant land)
- Insufficient closed sale data for accurate land value analysis

**Recommendation:** Contact local real estate agent or review Fulton County closed sales records for accurate vacant land comparable sales.

### Comparable Sales Analysis

**Search Limitations:**
- No recent sales found in $650K-$900K range in Grove Park
- Price point significantly exceeds typical neighborhood values
- Target range approximately 2-3x current market median

**Broader Market Context:**
- Renovated homes: $300K-$500K
- New construction: $496K-$530K documented
- Premium pricing requires exceptional location/quality/amenities

**Investment Implication:** Development at $650K-$900K price point would represent significant market risk, testing unproven price ceiling for neighborhood.

## 10. CONCLUSION

The property at 1967 Baker Road NW presents a complex investment opportunity in a neighborhood undergoing significant transition. Grove Park benefits from major infrastructure investment, strong regional economic fundamentals, and documented Beltline-related appreciation potential. However, current market softness, above-average crime rates, and a significant price gap between target development pricing ($650K-$900K) and current market ceiling ($500K-$530K) present substantial risks.

**Key Decision Factors:**

1. **Can the market support $650K-$900K pricing?** Current data suggests this would be 20-70% above proven price points. Success would require exceptional quality, unique features, or targeting relocators from higher-cost markets.

2. **Is market timing favorable?** Current market conditions (declining prices, extended DOM, low competition) suggest waiting for stabilization or planning for extended sales periods.

3. **Will Beltline appreciation materialize?** Historical data shows 17.9-26.6% additional appreciation within 0.5 mile of Beltline. However, timing of realization is uncertain.

4. **Can crime concerns be overcome?** F-grade for violent crime and property crime rates may limit buyer pool willing to pay premium prices.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with comprehensive parcel-specific due diligence, but maintain conservative assumptions about achievable pricing. Consider whether a more modest price point ($500K-$600K range) might offer better risk-adjusted returns. Engage local real estate professionals with specific Grove Park new construction experience before committing to development plans.

The opportunity exists, but success requires realistic pricing expectations, exceptional execution, patient capital, and likely a longer-term investment horizon than initially anticipated.
